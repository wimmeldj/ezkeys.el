;;; ezkeys.el --- Easy syntax for keymaps of highest precedence.  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Usage:
;;
;; Add the directory containing this file to your `load-path' and byte compile
;; optionally.
;;
;; tell ezkeys before you load it where your keymap definition will be. This needs to be a file in
;; your load path.
;; 
;; (setq ezk-keymap-path "some-file")
;;
;; Finally, load ezkeys
;; 
;; (require 'ezkeys)
;;
;; You may want to manually execute this before you define a keymap (ie. C-x e) because it sets the
;; proper indentation for a keymap definition in the file at `ezk-keymap-path'.
;;
;; Define a keymap with `ezk-defkeymaps'

A DEF is similar to the DEF in `define-key'. Except that DEF
cannot be nil. ie.

 a command (a Lisp function suitable for interactive calling),
 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),
 a symbol (when the key is looked up, the symbol will stand for its
    function definition, which should at that time be one of the above,
    or another symbol whose function definition is used, etc.),
 a cons (STRING . DEFN), meaning that DEFN is the definition
    (DEFN should be a valid definition in its own right),
 or a cons (MAP . CHAR), meaning use definition of CHAR in keymap MAP,
 or an extended menu item definition.

  "Define keymaps allocated on `emulation-mode-map-alists'

MAP is any number of forms like:
((KEY [KEY]...)... (DEF HOOK [HOOK]...)

KEY is a string like the strings provided to `kbd' (eg. \"C-x\"
\"<f10>\" etc.)

DEF is any DEF accepted by `define-key'. This is the action that
the key sequences perform.

HOOK is any ordinary hook, like `c-mode-hook' or
`lisp-mode-hook' (explicit). HOOK may also just be a symbol bound
to a mode - e.g. c-mode - (implicit). In this case, it's assumed
that the hook corresponding to `c-mode' has the standard name,
i.e. `c-mode-hook'. The hook need not be a variable currently
loaded when this macro is evaled. e.g. `python-mode-hook' may not
be available when emacs starts, but it's still okay to reference
`python-mode-hook' (explicit) or `python-mode' (implicit) when
calling this macro. When the code defining `python-mode-hook' is
eventually loaded, keymaps will work as expected.

Additionally, a hook may be the special symbol GLOBAL. Binding a
key to GLOBAL is similar to defining a key using
`global-set-key'. The binding will be available in all buffers
unless some other binding bound to a more specific hook
exists. In which case, the more specific binding overrides the
global binding in all buffers that run the hooks it's defined on.

===

GROUP-ALIST can be used to name a list of modes in a keymap
terminal form: (DEF HOOK [HOOK]...)

For instance, if GROUP-ALIST was

((LISP lisp-mode scheme-mode emacs-lisp-mode-hook))

Any terminal form that uses LISP as a hook, will apply the keymap
definition to all of the \"hooks\" in the cdr of the alist
member. In this case,

(DEF LISP)
= (DEF lisp-mode scheme-mode emacs-lisp-mode-hook)
= (DEF lisp-mode-hook scheme-mode-hook emacs-lisp-mode-hook)

You can use any number of these group aliases in a terminal form.

===

Hooks appearing earlier in PRECEDENCE-LIST have higher precedence
than those appearing later. So in the case that two modes are
active that bind the same key, the one appearing earlier in
PRECEDENCE-LIST will have its action taken. Any hook not included
in PRECEDENCE-LIST has a lower precedence than those
mentioned. This applies to all hooks except GLOBAL, which always
has the lowest precedence.
